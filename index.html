			<p>Taylor Swift is a singer, songwriter, and businesswoman known not only for
				hit songs such as <i>Shake It Off</i> and <i>Love Story</i>, but also for her sincerity 
				to fans and love for music. Since 2006, she has poured her heart into her work and created
				nine original albums to showcase her talent. Despite her deeply personal involvement in her musical 
				projects, her previous record label refused to sell her the ownership rights to her first six 
				albums - <i>Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, </i> and <i> Reputation</i>. These albums
				have instead been sold multiple times without consent from Swift. 
				This betrayal left her no choice but to rerecord these six albums and therefore reclaim ownership
				of her work.
				<br>
				<br>
				As we witness the execution of this bold business strategy by
				Swift, we hope to see the success of her efforts reflected in 
				sales, streams, and airplay. <i>Track It (Taylor's Version)</i>
				attempts to moniter the level of this success through daily tracking of 
				Swift's catelog on Spotify. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Spotify provides a metric called "popularity" that measures the performance of a song by 
				worldwide streaming patterns. Overall streams contribute to popularity, but recent streams
				have the greatest influence on this metric. This measurement is critical to
				a song's success on Spotify, as it heavily influences the probability that a track will
				be recommended to listeners and added to Spotify's major playlists. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>Track It (Taylor's Version)</i>
				has been collecting this data daily to produce a visual representation of the performance of Swift's
				rerecorded catelog compared to the original counterpart. We hope that this tool will remind 
				<span id='swiftieSpan'></span> of the
				importance of streaming Taylor's Version.
